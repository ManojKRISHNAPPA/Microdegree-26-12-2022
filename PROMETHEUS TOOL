Launch ubuntu 
Go to https://prometheus.io/download/
see the link prometheus-2.46.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz ---Right click on that link -----copy link adress
Go to ubuntu type wget paste above link
# Prometheus requires its own user to be running....And also tell it doesnot require any home directory----
# It should have the shell & it shouldnot use any perticular passworxd
sudo useradd --no-create-home --shell /bin/false prometheus
sudo mkdir /etc/prometheus
sudo mkdir /var/lib/prometheus
# both directories permission is root user permission now...lets change ownership to prometheus user
sudo chown prometheus:prometheus /etc/prometheus/
sudo chown prometheus:prometheus /var/lib/prometheus/
ls
# lets extrsxt that tar file
tar -xvf name of the prometheus tar file
ls
cd prometheus-2.46.0.linux-amd64

### here folders prometheus &  promtool are important ...so we need to move this some other folder....whenver my prometheus server get started it gets started with the hep of 
these two things. So to make it globally available we need to keep these two file in user local bin directories...
Why because any executable packages/ or commands will run from /usr/local/bin/
sudo mv prometheus /usr/local/bin/
sudo mv promtool /usr/local/bin/
### now these are in under ubuntu user permisssion...lets change permission to prometheus user
sudo chown prometheus:prometheus /usr/local/bin/prometheus
sudo chown prometheus:prometheus /usr/local/bin/promtool
ls
sudo mv console_libraries/ /etc/prometheus/
sudo mv consoles/ /etc/prometheus/
### change permission to prometheus user ####
sudo chown -R prometheus:prometheus /etc/prometheus/console_libraries/
sudo chown -R prometheus:prometheus /etc/prometheus/consoles/
#### now 50% of the things are ready....still we can not start our prometheus server....
To do this we need to have a pro configeration files...that is prometheus.yml
cat prometheus.yml (by seeing this only we can write our configeration file....also we can create our own...This is the configeration of our prometheus server.)
########  Also we must keep this pro.yml in /etc/prometheus locatin. (here it is yml)
sudo touch /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yaml (here we create yaml)
sudo chown prometheus:prometheus /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yaml

#### now we should write the configeration for the pro server in this file ####
sudo vi /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yaml

global:
  scrape_interval: 10s      #### it will say for how many secs prometheus should collect metrics from client exporter33333

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'prometheus'   ##### NAME CAN BE ANYTHING ....CAN BE OUR SERVER NAME #########
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:9090']   ####### we can mention pub ip or private ip in place of lical host also ##### and it says that please select port no 9090 in my local host.

      Now lets stsrt the pro server.....To do this we need to write system level service configeration file....that is systemctl service file
      We can see there are many system lever services are running in below location ...That is
      
      sudo cd /etc/systemd/system/

      Here we need to write service file for our prometheus....
