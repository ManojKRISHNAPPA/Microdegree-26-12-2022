If we access one service from another service then you should use access token.
Here we are  accessing kubernetes cluster through EC2 service using access token.
aws configure ( this is explained in previous file)
kubectl get nodes

KUBERNETES SERVICE:
This also kubernetes object....application we are going to expose using kubernetes serice. For that we need to create service object.
3 type of service objects are there....

1. cluster IP
2. node port ip
3. load balance IP


If i want to expose one application and i want to access within my cluster ...it should not acccess from outside world . Then it i called cluster ip
so from cluster ip service we are exposing some aplication then that will be accessible only within the cluster not from outside.

Node IP : Uing the external Ip of this perticular node we can acces our application from outside world.

Load balancer Ip : we can access our application from outside world using this load balancer url:
( here we can access our pod or application using any one of the above service)

Lets create deployment:
mkdir kube
cd kube
ls
vi deployment.yaml  (use previous deployment file)
